  <h1>Places I've Traveled</h1>
  <h2>United States</h2>
  <p><q>I have traveled all over the US.</q><br>
    I have visited large cities such as Los Angeles, Washington DC, and New York, and I have visited small towns such as Fort Plain and Ellensburg.</p>

  <h3><small>Everywhere Else</small></h3>
  <p><strong>I have visited Canada and Japan.</strong> Japan was interesting as it was similar in many ways to the US, but at the same time completely different. Candada is <em>basically</em> America Lite.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p><u>Too bad I don't like to travel.</u></p>
  <blockquote>I need to travel more.</blockquote>
